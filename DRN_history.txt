The Disrespect Nature company is rooted in American history. DNC was founded on July 4, 1776 in what is now known as New York, New York by Jebediah Jefferson, Benjamin Button, Susan Santrabolba and Abraham Abernackle. In case you forgot that was the day the colonies declared independence from the nature loving Brits. These four individuals wanted to make sure that the brand new country “America” would be protected from the evils of nature. Back then industry was still just an idea. The four friends used DNC to begin the industrial revolution, to guarantee that future generations would become effective at disrespecting nature and stomping every squirrel in their path.

Most of you probably know about the wonderful squirrel obliteration factories that DNC owns today. What you might not know is the first prototype of those factories was created by Jebediah, Benjamin, Susan, and Abraham over 250 years ago. It was known as the Hand-Crank Squirrel Squasher. If you can believe it, you could only squish 10 squirrels an hour. Now at our factories, you can destroy 100,000 a minute!
